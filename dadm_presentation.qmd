# Topics {style="font-size: 50%;"}

The following topics primarily correspond to specific chapters from the book by @Spiegelhalter2019Art. The dates when each presentation will take place are shown in column 1 of  @tbl-tpc. Topics will be randomly assigned to students who have officially registered. I communicate the assignment on October 17 in class and a bit later on ILIAS. The last column of @tbl-tpc contains the assignments, including the initials and matriculation numbers of registered students.

If you do not see your name on the list but have registered, please inform me as soon as possible. Please note that the presentation day is an official examination day, and failure to attend will result in a grade of 5.0. Ensure you do not miss this important day.
